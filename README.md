Fake Profile Identification Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake profiles on social media platforms using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing various features like profile completeness, activity patterns, and content authenticity, we aim to build an effective model that distinguishes real users from fake ones.

Features
Data Collection: Uses datasets containing real and fake profiles from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn).
Preprocessing: Cleans and processes text, images, and metadata for effective model training.
Feature Engineering: Extracts behavioral patterns, engagement levels, and profile metadata.
Machine Learning Models: Implements models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to measure model performance.

Dataset
Publicly available datasets like Kaggle Fake Profile Dataset or scraped data from social media APIs.
The dataset consists of profile attributes, textual data, and activity logs.
Usage
Run the model on a test dataset to classify profiles.
Visualize feature importance and model performance.
Deploy as a web service for real-time profile verification.
Results
Random Forest Model: 92% accuracy
SVM Model: 88% accuracy
Neural Network Model: 94% accuracy
